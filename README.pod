    use XML::LibXML::XPathContext;

    has xml_doc    => ( isa => Document, coerce => 1 );
    has namespaces => ( isa => XMLNamespaceMap, coerce => 1 );
    has xpath      => ( isa => XPathExpression, coerce => 1 );

    sub findnodes {
        my $self = shift;
        my $xpc  = XML::LibXML::XPathContext->new($self->xml_doc);
        while ( my ($prefix, $uri) = each %{$self->namespaces} ) {
            $xpc->registerNs($prefix, "$uri");
        }
        return $xpc->findnodes($self->xpath);
    }

    package main;
